    "\n",
    "The success of e-Car's business rests on providing rates that meet customer demand and generate profit for them. With this objective, e-Car's data set was analyzed to identify possible areas of improvement. The New Financing segment surfaced as a promising target for pricing optimization due to: (i) lower percentage of acceptance, (ii) relatively higher population size, and (iii) significant potential for higher profit due to higher principal amounts from higher-value vehicles. Additionally, a two-sample t-test showed that e-Car is pricing significantly higher than its competitors on the higher risk tiers (2, 3, 4). To optimize pricing, Gradient Boosting Classifiers were built to predict if a customer will accept or reject a loan offer from e-Car. The predictive model was then used to optimize pricing by iterating through a range of profitable rates. Thresholds for customer decision were set at values of rate, which would flip outcomes from a No to a Yes. Predictive models shown to be much more profitable by allowing profits in the New Financing segment to reach ~9.5M USD by setting optimal rate offers, better than the expected zero gain using e-Car's current pricing system. Implementing segment-specific models (e.g., according to Tier) showed to be more profitable."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The auto-loan business represents a sizeable amount of consumer credit in the United States. As of April 2019, the dollar value of new loans was estimated at $52.8 Billion[1]. This trend shows no sign of slowing as the forces driving it are inherently intertwined with the country's infrastructure and public policy. A 2019 Frontier Group study described car ownership as the \"price of admission to the economy\"[2]. Owning a private vehicle is a requirement to be part of American society.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study notes that individuals who own cars have greater access to jobs than their non-car owning counterparts; this is true even in areas with well-developed public transportation systems. Government spending also facilitates car ownership, with the bulk of government transportation spending going towards highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "This massive investment in highways helped spur the growth of suburban and exurban areas, normalizing consumers' lifestyles to take their cars to work. Due to these factors, Americans are pushed into car ownership. However, not all Americans can pay a lump sum for their vehicles and therefore require financing. The study found that in 2018, up to 85% of all new cars purchased and 53% of all used cars are financed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this set up is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it would be beneficial for firms to understand how best to meet consumers' financial needs. One such company is e-Car, and one such analytics company helping them is Nomis. e-Car began as the subsidiary of a larger bank and focused on auto loans, conducting their business exclusively online. The company generally gave rates much lower than their competitors and were able to penetrate the market successfully. Using the data e-Car had provided them, Nomis has been working to create a model and a data-driven strategy to help e-Car further improve its business."

    "Specifically, the team pursued the following more specific objectives:\n",
    "1. Assess and analyze e-Car's current customer segments and pricing,\n",
    "2. Perform a statistical comparison between e-Car's rates and its competitors,\n",
    "3. Build a model to classify and predict customer acceptance of rate offers, and\n",

The optimal hyperparameters used are learning_rate = 0.12, max_depth = 4, and n_estimators = 300. The models were trained and tested by splitting e-Car's dataset 75% and 25%, respectively.\n",

    "**Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Recommender** \\\n",
    "The created model from before was then used to identify the rate to which the outcome will change for the rejected loan accounts. The algorithm updates the rate for each loan account while keeping other features the same as the original account, then the data is fed to the model to check the outcome.\n",

Model B was trained four sets of training data (Tiers 1 to 4) and was also tested on test data sets for each Tier. This approach yielded a much higher total profit of 6,152,279 USD."

    "\n",
    "The team found that e-Car's original pricing can be further improved by implementing machine learning models to increase the acceptance rate of the loan offers. Through exploratory analysis, the group was able to find the segment (in terms of loan type) where e-Car was underperforming. This segment also represented the most significant opportunity loss among the three and increasing e-Car's performance in this segment would substantially increase the company’s profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The group was able to predict whether a customer would accept or reject an offer using the three predictive models. The group found that those who rejected e-Car's initial offer could still change their mind if the interest rate was lower. By setting a floor interest rate (to ensure profitability), the group was able to pinpoint what these rates were and subsequently compute the profit e-Car could have been making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team recommends making a similar approach to the two other segments (i.e., Refinance and Used Finance). In the future, creating new tiers is advised to determine the rate threshold for higher profitability."
